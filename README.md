The purpose of this repo is a way of checklist when I create a brand new repository.

### What is this repository for? ###

+ Quick summary
    * A _systematize-to_do-checklist_ formulæ when a repo is created
+ Version
    * 1.3


### How do I get set up? ###

+ Summary of set up
    - Read our latest [Checklist.md](https://bitbucket.org/imhicihu/good-practices-on-repository-creation/src/f7780177fb1ef16ce511c7f419c61aa3176b581f/Checklist.md?at=master) in the `Source` section. 
    - At some point, we will create a [milestone](https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issues/11528/make-milestones-and-versions-more). And then, enhance the walked road
+ Configuration
    - Depends mostly on Bitbucket, [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). ~~In the future, can occur a migration to [Github](https://github.com/)~~. 
    - In the meantime, some repos have been migrated~~/mirrored~~ to [Github](https://github.com/imhicihu) or are going to be migrated to [Read the docs](https://readthedocs.org/) for our inner documentation and tutorials. Please, check the workflow of this migration [here](https://bitbucket.org/imhicihu/documentation-migration-to-read-the-docs-experimental)
+ Dependencies
    - _the less, the better_. A personal [motto](http://dictionary.cambridge.org/es/diccionario/ingles/motto)
+ How to run tests
    - Create an account in [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) or [Github](https://github.com/) and begin to create your project
+ Deployment instructions
    - No mandatory "_to follow_". It is a "_good practice_" exercise and follow ~~my~~ our needs
