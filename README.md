    - In the meantime, some repos have been migrated~~/mirrored~~ to [Github](https://github.com/imhicihu) or some documentation to [Read the docs](https://readthedocs.org/) for our inner docs and tutorials. Please, check the workflow of this migration [here](https://bitbucket.org/imhicihu/documentation-migration-to-read-the-docs-experimental)

    - Create an account in [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) or [Github](https://github.com/) and begin to create your project
