# README #

The purpose of this repo is a way of checklist when I create a brand new repository.

### What is this repository for? ###

+ Quick summary
    * a systematize-to_do-checklist when create a new repo
+ Version
    * 1.0 (will suffer continous updates)


### How do I get set up? ###

+ Summary of set up
    * check _[issues](https://bitbucket.org/imhicihu/good-practices-on-repository-creation/issues?status=new&status=open)_. At some point, I will create a [milestone](https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issues/11528/make-milestones-and-versions-more). And then, enhance the walked road.
+ Configuration
    * depends mostly on Bitbucket, [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), and surely open-source projects.
+ Dependencies
    * _the less, the better_. A personal motto.
+ How to run tests
    * Sign up an account in [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) and begin to create your project
+ Deployment instructions
    * No mandatory "_to follow_". It is a "_good practice_" exercise and follows my needs.
