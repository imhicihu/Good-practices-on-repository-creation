### How do I get set up? ###

+ Summary of set up
    * check _[issues](https://bitbucket.org/imhicihu/good-practices-on-repository-creation/issues?status=new&status=open)_. At some point, I (We) will create a [milestone](https://bitbucket.org/site/master/issues/11528/make-milestones-and-versions-more). And then, enhance the walked road.
+ Configuration
    * depends mostly on Bitbucket, [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown). In the future, can occur a migration to [Github](https://github.com/). Mostly depends on our proxy server's _mood_.

+ How to run tests
    * Sign up an account in [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/) and begin to create your project
